# How-To-Guides


If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Core, our _How-to_ guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. They'll help you achieve an end result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

| **How-to-guides** | Get stuff done|
|--|--|
| [Activate a recovery mode](/how-to-guides/manage-ubuntu-core/use-a-recovery-mode) | Repair, restore or reinstall an impaired device |
| [Add a system user](/how-to-guides/manage-ubuntu-core/add-a-system-user) | Write a USB-based assertion to create a user |
| [Build a gadget snap](/how-to-guides/image-creation/build-a-gadget-snap) | Create a version of Ubuntu Core for your device |

Alternatively, our tutorials section contain step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Ubuntu Core is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Ubuntu Core or building a custom image for your device.

Take a look at our  _Reference section_ when  you need to know which options can be used, what functions the API supports, which rescue modes are supported and the contents of _gadget.yaml_.

Finally, for a better understanding of how Ubuntu Core works and how it can be used and configured, our _Explanation_ section helps you to expand your knowledge and become better at Ubuntu Core.
