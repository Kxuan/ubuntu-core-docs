# Bluetooth management


Bluetooth is a standard for wireless communication on short distances. It standardised multiple profiles for different use-cases such as music streaming, serial connections, message exchange, phone calls, and many others. It has been first published in 1994 and since then has been updated several times. The recent version called Bluetooth 5 is a major update and step forward towards the IoT market and it's needs.

Bluetooth is developed and published by the [Bluetooth Special Interest Group](http://www.bluetooth.com/)

# About BlueZ

BlueZ is the official Linux Bluetooth stack. It provides, in it's modular way, support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols.

Currently BlueZ consists of many separate modules:

* Bluetooth kernel subsystem core
* L2CAP and SCO audio kernel layers
* RFCOMM, BNEP, CMTP and HIDP kernel implementations
* HCI UART, USB, PCMCIA and virtual device drivers
* General Bluetooth and SDP libraries and daemons
* Configuration and testing utilities
* Protocol decoding and analysis tools

You can find more information about this on the BlueZ upstream homepage [here](http://www.bluez.org/)
