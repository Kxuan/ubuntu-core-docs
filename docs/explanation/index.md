# Explanation


Our explanatory and conceptual guides are written to provide a better understanding of how Ubuntu Core works and how it can be used and configured. They enable you to expand your knowledge and become better at Ubuntu Core.

| **Explanation guides** | Why it does what it does |
|--|--|
| [Snaps in Ubuntu Core](/explanation/core-elements/snaps-in-ubuntu-core) | Discover which snaps Ubuntu Core is built upon |
| [Refresh control](/explanation/refresh-control) | Updates that are finely managed and controlled  |
| [Security and sandboxing](/explanation/security-and-sandboxing) | Understanding security policies and configuration  |

For a simpler place to start your Ubuntu Core journey, our tutorials section contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Ubuntu Core is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Ubuntu Core or building a custom image for your device.

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Core, our _How-to_ guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a broader set of applications. They'll help you achieve an end-result but may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Take a look at our  _Reference section_ when  you need to know which options can be used, what functions the API supports, which rescue modes are supported and the contends of _gadget.yaml_.
