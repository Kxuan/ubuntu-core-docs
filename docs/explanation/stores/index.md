# Stores

A store provides the snap packages and signed assertions required to security maintain and update your devices.

## Running a store

Applications and updates are delivered from a _store_. By default, this is Canonicalâ€™s Snap Store, but it can also be a dedicated snap store of your own, controlled through a _brand account_.
