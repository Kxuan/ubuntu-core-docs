# Tutorials

This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Ubuntu Core is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing Ubuntu Core or building a custom image for your device.

We hope our tutorials make as few assumptions as possible and are broadly accessible to anyone with an interest in Ubuntu Core. They should also be a good place to start learning about Ubuntu Core, how it works and what it's capable of. 

| Tutorials | Step-by-step walkthroughs |

| [Create a custom image](/how-to-guides/image-creation/add-custom-snaps) | Build your own Ubuntu Core with your own apps |

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Core, take a look at our _How-to_ guides. These have more in-depth detail and can be applied to a broader set of applications.

Take a look at our  _Reference section_ when you need to know which options can be used, what functions the API supports, which rescue modes are supported and the contents of _gadget.yaml_.

Finally, for a better understanding of how Ubuntu Core works and how it can be used and configured, our _Explanation_ section enables you to expand your knowledge.
