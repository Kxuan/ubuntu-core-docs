# Try pre-built images

Ubuntu Core runs on a variety of hardware, and pre-built images are available for _amd64_ and _ARM_ platforms (among others). These images can also be installed on a virtual machine.

Pre-built images are ideal for exploration and experimentation, but they are not intended for deployment or use at scale. They include snaps to provide an onboarding and evaluation experience, alongside an SSH connection, and these are unlikely to be required in your own Ubuntu Core deployment. 

Ubuntu Core has instead been designed to facilitate creating, deploying, and managing secure custom images running on your hardware.

See [Supported testing platforms](/reference/testing-platforms) for links to image downloads, ant to learn how to create your own custom image, read our [Build an image](/tutorials/build-your-first-image/index) guide.
