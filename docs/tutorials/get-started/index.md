# Get-Started

Ubuntu Core has been designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and  management of secure custom images running on your own hardware. 

But pre-built test images are also available, for both x86-based PC-style hardware and ARM-based platforms. These testing images are ideal for exploration  and experimentation but they're not intended for deployment or for use at scale.

We have tutorials for both approaches, with a step-by-step guide to creating your own image, plus guides on running Ubuntu Core within a virtual machine or on a variety of x86-based and ARM-based systems.
