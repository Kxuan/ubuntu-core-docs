# Ubuntu Core documentation

**Ubuntu Core** is a version of the Ubuntu operating system designed and engineered for deploying IoT and embedded systems.

In Ubuntu Core, every element of the system runs within a confined sandbox using **Snap packages**, which are used exclusively to create a transaction-based system. **Security and robustness** are the key features, alongside being **easy to install, easy to maintain, and easy to upgrade**.

Ubuntu Core is ideal for embedded devices because it manages itself. Whether itâ€™s running on a **PC-style** system hidden for media streaming, or an **embedded ARM** device handling garage door automation, Ubuntu Core remains **transparent, trustworthy and autonomous**.

From Linux and maker space tinkerers, to the robotics, automotive and signage industries; from a single device, to a deployment of thousands: Ubuntu Core can handle it.
